                                My printer had an issue where printing in color would cause the black ink to jam. Printing in
                                grayscale worked fine for black text but removed all color. At first, I would manually edit PDF
                                files to separate the colored elements from the black ones. Later, I realized I could automate
                                this process with Python, which also gave me the chance to explore new libraries and improve
                                my programming skills.

                                The program takes a PDF file and converts it into images using the PyMuPDF library.
                                With the help of the PIL library, it checks each pixel and copies it to either a colored version
                                or a grayscale version. Both versions are then converted back into separate PDF files. To make
                                the program easier to use, I built a simple GUI using the PyQt library.

                                For our final project in EAPP (English for Academic and Professional Purposes),
                                we were tasked to write and present a concept paper. Since our section was STEM specialized in IT-CoE,
                                the topic had to be related to the industry. My group decided to propose a website for esports that
                                would help managers and players form teams, organize events, and host tournaments.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                We created a mockup design of the website. It was not functional and was rushed due to the limited time
                                given, but the project still allowed us to gain foundational knowledge in HTML and CSS. It also gave us a
                                clearer idea of how digital platforms can be used to support the growing esports community.

                                For our final project in General Physics 2, we created a dollhouse with a working lighting circuit.
                                It was designed to demonstrate our understanding of series and parallel circuits as well as other
                                electrical concepts we had studied. Since our section was STEM specialized in IT-CoE, the project
                                also required Arduino integration to combine electronics with programming.

                                We attended workshops where we learned the basics of using an Arduino. Our project included motion
                                sensors, potentiometers, buttons, and LEDs, all connected to bring the dollhouse to life. The system
                                was coded in the Arduino IDE using C++. This experience not only applied our lessons in physics but
                                also gave us practical exposure to hardware and programming, making the project both challenging and
                                rewarding.
