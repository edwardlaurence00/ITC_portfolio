                                I’m <b>Edward Laurence C. Estrella</b>, a first-year <b>BS Computer Science</b> student at 
                                <i>Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila</i>. I am from <i>Marilao, Bulacan</i>. 
                                My interest in technology started in high school and grew stronger through various projects. 
                                These experiences shaped my decision to pursue computer science and continue exploring innovation.

                                Outside of school, I spend my time on hobbies that keep me creative and active. 
                                <b>Gaming</b> inspires my curiosity and love for stories. 
                                <b>Cycling</b> gives me a way to relax and stay healthy. 
                                I also enjoy <b>working with tech</b> and experimenting with computers. 
                                These interests push me to keep learning, growing, and challenging myself 
                                in both academics and personal life.

                                    I’ve always been surrounded by games growing up. I started with simple browser games like 
                                    <i>Farmville</i>, then moved on to <i>Minecraft</i> and <i>Roblox</i>. I also explored MMOs like 
                                    <i>Club Penguin</i> and even emulated old <i>Pokémon</i> games. During the pandemic, I discovered 
                                    shooter games such as <i>Call of Duty Mobile</i> and <i>Apex Legends</i>, which introduced me to the 
                                    thrill of fast-paced, competitive gameplay. Over time, I found myself drawn to story-rich RPGs and JRPGs, 
                                    with the <b>Persona series becoming a major influence on me</b>. I’ve played <i>Persona 2</i> through 
                                    <i>Persona 5</i>, and the series really shaped my love for immersive storytelling and character-driven 
                                    experiences. Later on, a friend introduced me to gacha games, starting with <i>Genshin Impact</i>, and since 
                                    then I’ve tried more than a dozen of them. I’m still playing <i>Wuthering Waves</i> and 
                                    <i>Persona 5: The Phantom X</i> today, alongside other titles like <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i> and 
                                    <i>Project Zomboid</i>.

                                    When I was little, my dad got into cycling and made lots of friends who would ride with him to different places. 
                                    Occasionally, I would join their rides. One memory that stood out to me was our cycling tour around 
                                    <b>Corregidor Island</b>, where our group explored the historic remains of the eerie island on our bikes. 
                                    Cycling became a special bonding activity with my dad. Due to life, he quit after a couple of years and so did I. 
                                    During the pandemic however, I picked it back up again as an escape from being stuck at home. My dad would 
                                    occasionally join me too. I found cycling to be <i>very relaxing</i> and a great way to relieve stress. 
                                    Over time, I even made friends I could ride with. Unfortunately, due to college and the demands of life, 
                                    cycling has become less frequent for me, though it still holds a special place in me.

                                    My interest in video games naturally led me to develop a strong curiosity for <b>technology</b>. 
                                    To play the latest and greatest games, I had to learn about the right specifications and components. 
                                    I also started keeping track of the newest products and technologies being released. 
                                    During the pandemic, I found some old PCs and laptops that were broken. 
                                    I tinkered with them and managed to get a few working again. 
                                    In Grade 10, our computer subject focused on IT topics. 
                                    We learned how to <i>disassemble and reassemble a PC</i>, identify its different parts, and <i>crimp network cables</i>. 
                                    Those experiences made me appreciate both gaming and the technology that makes it possible.
