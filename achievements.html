                                This research was inspired by our group’s interest in <b>Gacha games</b> and their growing popularity, 
                                as well as concerns over their <i>gambling-like mechanics</i>. We investigated how probability, design choices, 
                                and storytelling affect player <b>engagement</b> and <b>spending behavior</b>. 
                                To narrow the scope, we studied three major titles: <b>Genshin Impact</b>, <b>Honkai: Star Rail</b>, 
                                and <b>Wuthering Waves</b>. Our participants included nine individuals, such as streamers and high-spending players, 
                                who provided insights through interviews.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The study found that <b>limited-time events</b>, <b>character design</b>, and <b>narrative depth</b> 
                                are key motivators for players, creating both excitement and attachment. 
                                However, the <i>randomness of gacha systems</i> often leads to impulsive spending and frustration, 
                                reflecting behaviors similar to gambling. While some players manage their budgets responsibly, 
                                others struggle with <b>financial strain</b> and <b>time management</b>. 
                                Ultimately, we concluded that gacha games are highly effective at sustaining engagement, 
                                but players must practice <i>mindful gaming</i> to avoid negative impacts.

                                This research explored the use of <b>coconut husk–clay mixtures</b> as a <i>sustainable insulation material</i>, 
                                with the goal of creating a low-cost and eco-friendly option for construction. 
                                Different sample mixtures with varying ratios were prepared and subjected to tests on <b>thermal insulation</b>, 
                                <b>compressive strength</b>, and <b>water absorption</b> to determine their performance.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Results showed that adding husk improved insulation properties and increased strength up to a certain point, 
                                with the mixture of <b>4% coconut husk with 96% clay</b> giving the best balance of thermal performance and durability. 
                                Higher husk content, however, led to greater water absorption, which may limit long-term performance. 
                                Overall, coconut husk fibers proved to be a promising material for sustainable and cost-effective construction.
